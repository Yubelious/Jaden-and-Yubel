/*Changelog*/
3.1 Small changes to match the new version of the CSS fixes project. Adjusted the text shadows. Added a filter to the opponent's RPS buttons.

3.0 Version 2 didn't last as long as I expected. Dueling Nexus released a patch that killed half my theme. So I moved all of my CSS fixes to a new project, and started this from scratch after I stablized that one. Wrote new CSS to affect the new nav pages with mostly the same colour scheme and images (some of the positioning can no longer be duplicated), resized button images, and added a new log-in animation. A lot of things were lost during the move.

2.2 Positioned and sized each button on the navbar to fix mobile issues, resized the login/register tabs, moved some things around to make them appear better on mobile, fixed the buttons in the deck editor, added solid fallback colours to gradients/transparency.

2.1 Coded the settings tab that showed up a couple months ago, added settings tab related things to the global code, set min-width of buttons to 0 for smaller resolutions, adjusted the padding on .h3, adjusted the margin on .h2, resized .h2 and .h4, added a new logo to the duel and editor pages, moved the #downloadDeck.engine-button away from the standard buttons, fixed a bug with padding that caused the .engine-buttons to push beyond the bottom of the #editor-menu-container on lower resolutions, adjusted said .engine-buttons to be more similar on all resolutions, reduced the font size in #card-description-box to prevent an unsightly horizontal scrollbar, set the font weight of #card-if-monster to bold to match the bold in the card image, coded in a box in siding, filled the box with a description on how to side, z-indexed the button#game-siding-done.

2.0 Added a solid colour to the background for before the huge background image loads, completely rewrote the navbar from the ground up, found a way to set apart the Chat button from the disabled buttons since it still works while logged out, designated "a" more specifically, designated buttons more specifically, designated tables more specifically, styled a link on the register page, fixed the checkbox label, fixed a bug that affected an animation on the login button, moved the login/register container down to allow room for the alert on smaller resolutions, adjusted said alert, specified padding around the new .profile-if-not-contributer (ads and progress bar), removed the margin from .profile-if-not-contributer, styled the new buttons found on the news tab, added padding to #newsMain so the computer's taskbar doesn't block the interface, styled the progress bar, made .mlabel a lot more noticable (you can't miss it!), adjusted the padding on the duel home buttons, hid the duel tab's overflow to prevent a scrollbar from appearing, changed the quote on the Decks tab from Jaden's "Get your game on!" to Yubel's "Now prepare to feel my wrath!" as this is where you prepare for a duel, replaced the duel table background with a higher quality version, replaced the decks table background with a new image, moved the buttons on the deck tab, added a new background to the container in login/register, resized the login/register container to fit the new background, adjusted the a links in the login/register container, added the words "Dueling Nexus" to duels, added a bouncing ball animation while waiting for a duel to connect, added a Yu-Gi-Oh! logo behind "Dueling Nexus", rewrote the entire siding screen, rewrote much of the deck pages into siding to reduce lines of code, imported some Google Fonts into the style, added effects to the avatar, set min-height/min-width for engine buttons so empty buttons are easier to click, added content to all of the engine buttons in the game option list so the bottoms line up, made minor changes to the duel field gradients, coded the name announce window, resized the rps pictures so they fit better on all resolutions, changed the colour of selectable field zones.

1.4 Adjusted buttons to match the new VRAINS-era Dueling Nexus, added a scrollbar to the announce window.

1.3 Tested in multiple resolutions, tested using multiple browsers, darkened and resized table, added an indent + word-break to the username under the Avatar in-duel, cleaned up the deck constructor on 720p, moved the chat box away from the bottom of the screen, messed around with transparency, fixed the siding screen, moved the loading container down, added an animation to the options pop-up, and added a delay to the spinning buttons.

1.2 Tested in multiple resolutions, changed some units of measurements to reflect those resolutions, collapsed the border of the search result table, added a few scroll bars, added more transparent gradient backgrounds, made the search description move when hovered over, hid .loadmore, more green h4, got rid of some things made obsolete by an update, fixed the buttons on the login screen, tried a new "not-allowed" button setup, modified most of the text shadows, changed some colours around in the .engine-buttons, added more scrollbars, and contained chat inside a box.

1.1 Made text even larger, fixed a border collapse (kinda), pulled in #tab-duel p to top left corner, added a new background image, moved some things around, "Ready" button no longer flips upside down when hovered over, increased the size of the duel menu, and changed the colour of the bar on the top.

1.0 I made everything bigger, with a goal of seeing it across the room. I also added some images that match a theme. While waiting for a duel, click-and-hold the "Ready" button and pull down. The button will spin like and hourglass.
